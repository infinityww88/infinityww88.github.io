## Biography

Currently I am a third year Ph.D. candidate of School of Biological Science & Medical Engineering in Southeast University. I joined Institute of Data Science of Maastricht University as a visiting researcher from 2021. My research interest is information extraction and knowledge graph.

I received my B.Sc. degree in Mechatronic Engineering in June 2015 from Mechanical Engineering and Automation College of Xihua University. Then I got my M.Sc. degree in Forestry Information Engineering in June 2019 from Information and Computer Engineering College of Northeast Forestry University. CV

## Recent Update

- Biomedical Information Extraction from Text
- Knowledge graph in Biomedical Domain
- Estimation of epidemiological parameters from differential equations

## Research Interests
